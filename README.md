# Sniffs-and-Woofs

An app that lets your pets meet other pets in the neighborhood.

This app was made because a lot of neighborhoods don't have dog parks and a lot of dogs don't have siblings to play with. Thus, this app is to help pet owners find friends for their pets.

Please go [here](https://github.com/SuperJones/Sniffs-and-Woofs/issues) to check out the issues and contribute to the project.
The labeling system is based off [this Blog post](https://medium.com/@dave_lunny/sane-github-labels-c5d2e6004b63)
